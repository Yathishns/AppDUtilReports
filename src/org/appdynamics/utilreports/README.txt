First the current method of getting the information is ok but we need to be able to change the time ranges  and let the user decide how they want to measure the collections

BT is BT index type 

BT metrics are index 0
BE metrics are index 1
EUM-AJAX metrics are index 5
EUM-BASE metrics are index 6
EUM-IFRAME metrics are index 7

Now that we have the list of BTs, lets start grabbing the auto for .Net, can I find out the type ?

If we can then map the BTs to what created them, we can then make a quick determination what is valid and what is not.

Adding the ability to create custom match rules on the fly the first step is to get all of the BTs that exist
then using then figure out which tier they belong too. then based up on that create the rule for each.
